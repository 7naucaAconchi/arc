## What You Need to Download Free Xbox 360 Games for Full Version on USB
 
Before you start downloading free Xbox 360 games for full version on USB, you need to have some things ready. Here is what you need:
 
- A computer with a good internet connection.
- A USB flash drive with enough space to store the games. You can use any size of USB flash drive, but we recommend at least 16 GB for better performance.
- A modded Xbox 360 console that can run unsigned code. You can either buy a pre-modded Xbox 360 or mod it yourself using a software or hardware method. Modding your Xbox 360 will void your warranty and may get you banned from Xbox Live, so do it at your own risk.
- A software to transfer the games from your computer to your USB flash drive. You can use any software that can copy files to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive, such as Xplorer 360 or Horizon.
